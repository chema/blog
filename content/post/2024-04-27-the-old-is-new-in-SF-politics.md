So [some dude is having feverish dreams](https://newrepublic.com/article/180487/balaji-srinivasan-network-state-plutocrat) of turning San Francisco into some sort of nightmarish, tech-controlled dystopia.

This desire isn't at all unique. San Francisco has always been packed with people trying to mold the city into their very own personal vision. The only difference is this particular individual has money and influence. He will fail, of course, and he probably already knows it, but sharing his fantasies will still bring him clout among his historically-uneducated peers and attention is addictive.<!--more-->

But even if his scheme is doomed to fail, it is worth using this opportunity to remind people that what he is proposing, at its core, is not really new. The idea of creating a politically-dominant social class around an arbitrary attribute (in this case, gray shirts that signal techie cred) is just 21st century "[Big Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_man_(anthropology))" politics.

It is a retrograde perspective founded on the ideas that the "masses" should not have a meaningful say in collective decisions by removing them entirely as a constituency and that the only way to achieve *actual* progress should be left to the wise overlords. After all, why even bother persuading the poors to vote for your measures or candidates if they don't even live here? It is the immature response of a man that is unable to deal with the very normal political tension (and despite having a disproportinate ability to project his political perspective thanks to his wealth).

People like this aren't just turning their back on modern society and [Liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism), but skipping and running towards feudalism and a neo-caste-based society. Don't buy into the political [obscurantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscurantism) peddled by these folks. It is snake oil.
