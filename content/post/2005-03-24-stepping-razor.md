So, it's a Thursday night / Friday morning here in Old LÃ´zane and me and geeky LC are sitting on our computers. I am writing this, and reading Wikipedia. LC is going over The Onion and insisting that she is not geeky through imaginative, albeit bizarre, methaphors involving small predators and my friends.

Her weak defense of her geek quotient lead -obviously to those who know us- to an interesting debate regarding if raccoons were actually predators or trashivores. I won the argument by stating that if they were trashivores, then they could not have existed before the existance of trash. She then cheered herself up by checking my spelling.

Because of popular demand of more content on this "thing", I kept thinking about interesting things to write about. Now, I distinctly remember that at some point in the past couple of days I said "Hey, now that shit's worth writing about!". Surprinsingly enough though, my mind went blank now. I shall try to remember slowly.

We watched two movies today: *Harrold and Kumar Go to White Castle* and *Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure*. The latter was one of my, perhaps the most, favorite movie during the late eighties. LC said it was a waste of her time and that she would have rather walked around, in the rain, stepping on poop and listening to the drunken sounds of the local natives. The other one was enjoyed by all, but not at the same level. LC's favorite part was the battleshits. Just kidding.

Well, tomorrow I'll upload some pictures of the Olde Chemistrie Schoole and Cuyo's Headquarters.
