To great controversy, the ultra-rich and powerful owners of [The Washington Post](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/business/media/washington-post-presidential-endorsement.html?unlocked_article_code=1.VE4.YiLQ.P2NIg98lh5Yf&smid=url-share) and [The Los Angeles Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/business/media/la-times-editor-quits-patrick-soon-shiong-endorsement.html?unlocked_article_code=1.VE4.KPRr.58eopUMCx9jP&smid=url-share) directed staff at these two dailies not to endorse any candidate in the upcoming, highly contested presidential election, which is currently a dead heat.<!--more-->
