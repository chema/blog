This is a list of items that I own that I generally find to be high quality, hard wearing, vegan and appear to be ethically produced. They are not always the cheapest, but they serve me well and I consider them well worth the price.

### Writing

* __Pen__: I like to take handwritten notes for work. I usually go through a few composition books a year, which meant I was going through a handful of pens and refills as well, with all the waste associated with it. This waste was eliminated when I started using a fountain pen. I love my brass [Schon DSGN Pocket Six](https://www.schondsgn.com/collections/fountain-pens/products/brass-pocket-six-fountain-pens). Since I have had it, I have not had to use another pen. I use a Kaweco squeeze converter and have been refilling it with Kaweco Midnight Blue ink (which is vegan!) using a blunt needle syringe. The pen does not leak, fits in my pocket and will outlast me if I can avoid losing it.
* __Mechanical Pencil__: I really appreciate my rOtring 600, but it is fragile and expensive so I only use it at home. I carry a Pentel Graph Gear 1000 with me daily since the tip is retractable. Both pencils hold 0.7mm lead. I prefer 2B lead, which is softer and darker than the standard HB lead. It is great for writing under any condition.
* __Ruler__: Having a good ruler is really useful when taking notes so I usually have two. I keep a small 10cm/4inch Mitutoyo stainless steel flexible ruler in my pocket notebook and a 16cm Traveler's Company brass ruler in my briefcase.
* __Notebooks__: I like to take notes in composition notebooks. Normal paper works fine with my fountain pen. I recommend the Top Flight composition notebook. For pocket notebook, I use a generic "Field Notes" style notebook with perforated pages. For journals, I use Leuchtturm1917 A5 or A6 notebooks.

### Conveyance

* __Bike__: I currently use a steel Univega bike, but dearly miss my Masi touring bike, which was stolen out of my garage a few years back. Steel bikes are heavy and I might have to move to aluminum at some point, but so far I can manage and it is very comfortable when riding in the city. I also ride bike share quite a bit since it avoids the risk of my bike getting stolen.
* __Car__: I made it my first four decades without a car, but my work's collective bargaining agreement forced me to get one in 2018. I ended up getting a secondhand 2002 Toyota Prius. I rarely use it, but runs great for a 22-year-old vehicle. It is a hybrid car that gets about 50 miles per gallon and lacks any distractions that make modern cars more dangerous, such as the huge screens in the middle of the dashboard.

### Bags

* __Briefcase__: My daily work briefcase is a DEFY bags slim canvass briefcase. It is made in the US and still looks new even though it is dragged around daily. I generally recommend vegan bags made by DEFY since I think they are worth the money.
* __Back Pack__: I have a Goruck GR1 that I got second hand on Craigslist for longer trips or camping. It is an excellent bag, and same as DEFY bags, I recommend Goruck's vegan bags but it is probably best to get them second hand since their lifetime warranty makes it worth it.

### Pocket Tools
* __Multitools__: My multitool of choice is the Leatherman Curl, which I consider to be an almost perfect multitool for me. It is light, smallish, has pliers, a cutting blade, a bit driver, scissors and a few other things. I also have a Surge in my home tool kit and a Style PS for airplane travel.
* __Pocket Knife__: I have two pocket knifes, both which are less than 3 inches so I can carry them on me anywhere in California. My fancy pocket knife is a Benchmade Mini Griptilian 556-1 in CPM-20CV steel, which is incredible. Benchmade sharpens their knives for free, but more importantly, they replace damaged blades, which I have already taken advantage of. This knife was normally expensive, but I got an crazy good deal on it at REI. My other knife is a humble Ontario Rat 2. Simpler steel, but very good knife as well.
