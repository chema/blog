Yet another person was killed crossing the street [this morning](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/parnassus-heights-pedestrian-killed-dump-truck-19854329.php)â€”once again by a professional driver behind the wheel of a large vehicle.<!--more-->

It happened at Parnassus Avenue and Stanyan Street, a transit corridor in one of San Francisco's nicest and supposedly [safest neighborhoods](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/realestate/cole-valley-san-francisco-where-high-prices-meet-low-inventory.html).

This city will go and recall elected officials over "out-of-control" crime. [Hundreds of my neighbors](https://www.reddit.com/r/CAguns/comments/1b3i921/ccw_approved_san_francisco/) have applied for concealed carry weapons permits to defend themselves. "Public safety" remains [the top issue this election](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/politics/sf-crime-rates-drop-while-voters-prioritize-public-safety/article_6df674fe-7b8e-11ef-a982-63d900366b3f.html).

Meanwhile, actual, deadly, traffic violence gets the San Francisco version of "thoughts and prayers": Some paint will be thrown down, a bit of plastic will be put up and robotaxis will be deployed.
