my weekend came and went just like that. didn't even notice it. slept most of the time i think. it's a crying shame, but i still have a few more hours... about 23.

i haven't been able to contact lc. i tried calling, but whomever answered didn't understand, so i hung up. then i spent a good amount of time on the phone talking to my voip provider in what seemed like a futile attempt to improve the call quality to egypt, but i don't think it had much impact. well, perhaps it did, at least the people at the hotel can hear me, but since i haven't talked to lc, it seems like it hasn't.

i had a big-ol'-bottle o' beer just now. not very good, but it gave me a buzz. and buzzes are always good.
