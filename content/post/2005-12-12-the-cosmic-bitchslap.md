I was reading the few entries I made before and they seem so unlike my life. I am reserving judgement on that being good or bad for the moment, but the suddeness of how my life has changed in the past nine months surprises me. I was aware things would change, they had to. I needed to continue with my education, which I did. I new LC would finish hers, which she also did. And I also knew that the Chemistry School would be no more by the end of the year, and that it most surely did. The only real "surprises" are my parents returning to MÄ“xihco and this deep funk I find myself in. Life changes, it always does, but it's the emotions that really impact us in the end. Not really wise as thoughts go, quite obvious really but these past few months have really demonstrated that emotions are not to be fucked with.
