i decided, after a little hesitation, to start a "blog". why the quotes? frankly, back in my day (i.e 1995) a "blog" was nothing more than a home page, but i guess these youngings need to feel like they were the ones that invented fire. and perhaps that's the way things should be. all generations need to feel like the things they use, the things they value, are unique, new. who am i to disagree? after all, i am guilty of the same crime.

little cuyo's still in egypt. i miss her, i wish i could call, but i haven't been able to get through and she hasn't checked her email. i'm sure she's having a good time. i need to keep positive, send out good vibes, no need to get worried.

tomorrow night i am going to start checking the server, start re-installing openbsd on it, get the older hard drive in it and set it up so i can host my blog on it. it isn't that i don't trust the google people, but really, should anyone have so much power, even if their motto is "do no evil"? i don't think so.

i just realized i don't know what language i should write this blog in. i started to write in in english, but that was a reaction based on the context. perhaps i'll just let it work itself out slowly.

anyway, i'm gonna read a bit, then hit the hay. gonna begin "quicksilver" again, been too long since i began...
