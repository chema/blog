description: "Wild Earth Pet Food: this is Tiny Luna. She's a sweet and friendly little puppy that loves life and her family. A Chihuahua/Poodle/Pomerenian/Pit Bull/French Bulldog/Collie mega mix, she was rescued from Tullare County by the SF SCPA and now living in San Francisco. She defeated parvo, pneumonia and valley fever before she was four months. Today she loves walks along the Waterfront, running uphill, laying in the sun and looking out into the Bay. Hobbies include chewing cardboard, chasing socks and her tail and taking naps."
