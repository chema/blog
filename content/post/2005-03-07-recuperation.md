A long day is finished. For reasons unknown, today was terrible. I think I'm not sleeping right, or perhaps not eating right, or I don't know. Working here at Cuyo's HQ is hard work, but this fatigue can't be explained by it. Or maybe I'm just exaggerating. Anyway, once LC comes back, I will feel better. Firstly from having her back again. I miss her a lot. Secondly, her imagination helps me a lot. I spent so much time this coming up with the menu it was incredible. LC is so much better at it than me.

Récup was excellent. I didn't feel like doing it, so Manu and my mom went up there to get it. Many many veggies. Excellent for a ratatouille. Good with some socca and a nice salad. Kind of a summer food, but maybe it will get people in the mood for that mind set too.

Récup (from récuperation) is the french term for dumpster diving food. Not as gross as it sounds. Firstly, this is Switzerland. Everything is quite clean and well separated in individual plastic bags. On top of that, a lot of the shit we find is anything but : everything is in excellent shape and perfect for cooking. We can reduce costs about 50% by récuping, give better quality food, healthier and I feel like I am doing something good for the world. How can I leave food to get burned like that?
