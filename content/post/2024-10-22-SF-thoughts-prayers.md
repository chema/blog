Yet another person was killed crossing the street [this morning](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/parnassus-heights-pedestrian-killed-dump-truck-19854329.php)â€”once again by a professional driver behind the wheel of a large vehicle.<!--more-->

It happened at Parnassus Avenue and Stanyan Street, a transit corridor in one of San Francisco's nicest and supposedly [safest neighborhoods](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/realestate/cole-valley-san-francisco-where-high-prices-meet-low-inventory.html). It's a neighborhood I know well, having lived around the corner from the intersection where this sad incident occurred. It is a small, calm neighborhood next to UCSF Parnassus and Golden Gate Park.

This city will go and recall elected officials over "out-of-control" crime. [Hundreds of my neighbors](https://www.reddit.com/r/CAguns/comments/1b3i921/ccw_approved_san_francisco/) have applied for concealed carry weapons permits to defend themselves. "Public safety" remains [the top issue this election](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/politics/sf-crime-rates-drop-while-voters-prioritize-public-safety/article_6df674fe-7b8e-11ef-a982-63d900366b3f.html).

Meanwhile, actual, deadly traffic violence gets the San Francisco version of "thoughts and prayers": some paint will be thrown down, a bit of plastic will be put up, and robotaxis will be deployed.

And, to be fair, it's like that in most places. But it shouldn't be like that; and certainly not in a city as small and dense as San Francisco. I hope San Franciscans realize one day that we don't have to be indifferent to these tragedies.

I've been advocating for a safer San Francisco free from traffic violence for most of my adult life, and sometimes I do feel optimistic. But then something like this happens, and I feel a rush of outrage and disappointment. I hope more people feel the same, and I hope we can put an end to these senseless deaths together, regardless of how our lives might be inconvenienced.

So, I am not including a link to an advocacy organization, a petition to sign, or an elected official's email you can write a strongly-worded email to. All those actions can be important. But so is anger that people keep dying on our streets and nurturing that feeling can be action enough, sometimes.
