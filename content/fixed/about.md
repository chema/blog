Welcome to my little vanity project! My name is Chema Hernández Gil. I was surprised to find this domain name available back in 2011 and since I live in a San Francisco and my family is from another San Francisco, it felt meant to be.

I was raised in the Bajío, on the northern shore of Lake Ontario and in Middle Tennessee—in the Central Mexican Matorral, Southern Great Lakes Forests & Interior Plateau US Hardwood Forests ecoregions respectively, all in the [Northern American biogeographical realm](https://www.oneearth.org/realms/northern-america/). North American through and through I guess.

I later spent my twenties on the shores of the Léman, including too many years studying at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. I spend my these days working as a labor organizer, walking [Luna](https://social.sanfranciscan.org/@luna), camping when I can and on geeky projects when I can't.

I had the good fortune of being raised vegetarian and decided to become vegan around 2003. I am co-founder of [Seed the Commons](https://seedthecommons.org/), a grassroots organization that works to create sustainable and just food systems that are independent of animal exploitation. You can [donate to support our important work here](https://donate.stripe.com/dR6bJD4ru3Frayc3cd).

I was a member of the [San Francisco Redistricting Task Force](https://sf.gov/public-body/2020-census-redistricting-task-force) tasked with redrawing the district lines for 2022 to 2032. My exhaustive thoughts on that process and on the final redistricting map can be found in [the official Final Report, under my Member Statement](https://sf.gov/sites/default/files/2022-05/2021-2022%20San%20Francisco%20Redistricting%20Task%20Force%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf), starting on page 41.

I was a member of the [East Cut Community Benefit District](http://theeastcut.org/about-us/) board of directors (and voted for the name "East Cut") for many years. I'm also a former elected board director of the [San Francisco Bicycle Coalition](http://www.sfbike.org/about/board-of-directors/) and a former elected member of the [Sierra Club, San Francisco local group](https://www.sierraclub.org/san-francisco-bay/leadership-roster#sf) executive committee. I spent many years as a media activist/accredited journalist during the heydays of Indymedia.
