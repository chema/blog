I keep having all these ideas about what my next entries will be about, but I always forget them. I wish I had more motivation to write, sometimes I feel like I'm having a particularly lucid day and it seems like I'm really progressing on some thread, and then it just disappears. A real shame.

I went to see a studio this morning near the university. It was nice, and cheap, so I decided to take it. It will be nice to move in in a couple of weeks time. It's been a while since I've had a place to my own not squatted. And it was that thought that made me feel guilty earlier about just squatting LC's place. I didn't really plan it, but I felt so comfortable there after a while it just happened. I need to remember to make it up to her one day.

I've been playing around with a new web application. Very nice way of organizing bookmarks, elegant. I'm sure it's gonna be ruined soon, now that it got bought out. I'd love to set up something similar on a server, along with a good wiki or blogging system. I'm sure there has to be something like that around, but if there isn't, I think I ought to try making one. I really should program something of consequence soon, otherwise I'm just going to forget how to do it, if I haven't already.

I should take note of the ideas, otherwise this blog will be nothing more than egotripping.
