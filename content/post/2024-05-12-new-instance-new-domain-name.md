title: New Instance, New Domain Name

I finally deployed an alternate fediverse instance using [snac](https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2) today.  I opted for a new domain name, settling on [ctrvx.net](https://ctrvx.net/). It's a throwback to my very first email address from 30 years ago – which had a *crtvx1* subdomain – back when I was a freshman in high school and was lucky enough to have internet access through my local university's [VAX mainframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX).<!--more-->

Taking inspiration from the original VAX acronym, the domain name is now a play on words, signifying a *c*en*tr*al *v*irtual e*x*tension into the *net*work, which is an apt description of it.

Rather proud of this little silly accomplishment.

If there are no issues with this snac instance, I expect that I will migrate [social.sanfranciscan.org](https://social.sanfranciscan.org/) to it and wind down that instance.
