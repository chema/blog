wow, i'm very tired. tonight was surreal. me and manuel went to geneva to a concert. we got there, paid, only to realize that it was the wrong date. no biggie, a little talking, and we got our 15 francs back each. then we went to my old place of employment (name withheld for complicate reasons). we hung around, heard some music and ran into a lot of people, some which i was actually happy to see, mainly bak.

at around 1h15, we started heading back to the train station. as sometimes happens, we got there 30 minutes too late. we had two choices : either wait until 5h00, or hitch back home. we decided it'd be faster to hitch back.

we went out near the botanical gardens, waited maybe 20 minutes and this dude picks us up. nice guy, sixty-two year old chinese man who was brought up here. he was really bummed out (not too sure why), but we talked a lot, and it was good. it made me think, and that's never a bad thing. we invited him to the squat for some oolong, and then talked about laotzu and zhuangzi for a couple of hours. gave him my pathetic attempt at calligraphy which i think he enjoyed. it turned out the dude was the son of one of a wealthy art collector who owned land in hong kong. well shit, everything happens for a reason no?

millionaires and squatters, united for one cause.
