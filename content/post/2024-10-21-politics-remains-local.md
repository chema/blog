It is just a couple of weeks until Election Day. I remain (professionally) focused on the San Francisco ballot—no choice in the matter, it's my bread and butter[^1]. That said, I did take a moment this evening to glance at the forecasts for the presidential election.<!--more-->

The race remains a toss-up. A small, particularly rational part of me finds this crazy, but I also know better than to underestimate how divided this country is. Whatever happens come November 6, that reality certainly isn’t going to change.

And so, my politics will remain local, because I figure that this is and will remain a valuable orientation, as it always has been, since all we had were little villages. A community exists regardless of any charter or constitution; it organically ebbs and flows, unlike states and the country.

The only other political scope that interests me is the global one, for sort of the same reasons. We all have to share this one planet.
