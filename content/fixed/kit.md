Here is a list of items that I own that I generally find to be high quality, hard-wearing and vegan. Many are made by small, US-based manufacturers, with the hope that the production is more just and ethical. They are not always the cheapest, but they serve me well and I consider them well worth the price. I started this list because finding legitimate reviews online is nearly impossible these days.

### Writing

* __Pen__: I like to take handwritten notes for work. I usually go through a few composition books a year, which meant I was going through a handful of pens and refills as well, with all the waste associated with it. This waste was eliminated when I started using a fountain pen. I love my brass [Schon DSGN Pocket Six](https://www.schondsgn.com/collections/fountain-pens/products/brass-pocket-six-fountain-pens). Since I have had it, I have not had to use another pen. I use a Kaweco squeeze converter and have been refilling it with Kaweco Midnight Blue ink (which is vegan!) using a blunt needle syringe. The pen does not leak, fits in my pocket and will outlast me if I can avoid losing it. I have a backup PEI ("*Ultem*") pen that I got from Aliexpress for about $20. It is also well made and should last me a long time, but the nib writes a bit too wet for my taste.
* __Mechanical Pencil__: I really appreciate my rOtring 600, but it is fragile and expensive so I only use it at home. I carry a Pentel Graph Gear 1000 with me daily since the tip is retractable. Both pencils hold 0.7mm lead. I prefer 2B lead, which is softer and darker than the standard HB lead. Pencils are useful when pens aren't practical.
* __Ruler__: Having a good ruler is really useful when taking notes so I usually have two. I keep a small 10cm/4inch Mitutoyo stainless steel flexible ruler in my pocket notebook and a 16cm Traveler's Company brass ruler in my briefcase.
* __Notebooks__: I like to take notes in composition notebooks. Normal paper works fine with my fountain pen. I recommend the Top Flight composition notebook. For pocket notebook, I use a generic "Field Notes" style notebook with perforated pages. For journals, I use Leuchtturm1917 A5 or A6 notebooks.

### Conveyance

* __Bike__: I currently use a steel Univega bike that I got off Craigslist for free a decade ago, but dearly miss my Masi touring bike, which was stolen out of my garage a few years back. Steel bikes are heavy and I might have to move to aluminum at some point, but so far I can manage and it is very comfortable when riding in the city. I also ride bike share quite a bit since it avoids the risk of my bike getting stolen.
* __Car__: I made it my first four decades without a car, but my work's collective bargaining agreement forced me to get one in 2018. I ended up getting a secondhand 2002 Toyota Prius. I rarely use it, but runs great for a 22-year-old vehicle. It is a hybrid car that gets about 50 miles per gallon and lacks any distractions that make modern cars more dangerous, such as the huge screens in the middle of the dashboard.

### Bags

* __Briefcase__: My daily work briefcase is a DEFY bags slim canvass briefcase. It is made in the US and still looks new even though it is dragged around daily. I generally recommend vegan bags made by DEFY since I think they are worth the money.
* __Back Pack__: I have a Goruck GR1 that I got second hand on Craigslist for longer trips or camping. It is an excellent bag, and same as DEFY bags, I recommend Goruck's vegan bags but it is probably best to get them second hand since their lifetime warranty makes it worth it.

### Pocket Tools
* __Multitools__: My multitool of choice is the Leatherman Curl, which I consider to be an almost perfect multitool for me. It is light, smallish, has pliers, a cutting blade, a bit driver, scissors and a few other things. I also have a Surge in my home tool kit and a Style PS for airplane travel.
* __Pocket Knife__: I have two pocket knifes, both which are less than 3 inches so I can carry them on me anywhere in California. My fancy pocket knife is a Benchmade Mini Griptilian 556-1 in CPM-20CV steel, which is incredible. Benchmade sharpens their knives for free, but more importantly, they replace damaged blades, which I have already taken advantage of. This knife was normally expensive, but I got an crazy good deal on it at REI. My other knife is a humble Ontario Rat 2. Simpler steel, but very good knife as well.
* __Watches__: A wristwatch is practical and a good way to avoid the distractions of a cellphone display. I generally prefer the solar-powered, radio-controlled square G-Shocks because they require little maintenance. My daily wearer is the all-black GW-B5600.

### Computer and Peripherals

* __Laptop__: My daily driver is an XPS 13 9380. It has been a decent laptop, but only because I opted for the extended warranty and it got the (multiple) repairs it needed before said warranty expired.
* __Mice__: I use the Logitech Master series mice; the very ergonomic MX Master 3 at my desk at home (acquired for free from a neighbor) and the smaller MX Anywhere 3 anywhere else. Both are excellent mice, highly recommended. The only issue I've had is that getting the smaller Anywhere on my dual boot system required a bit of research and configuration, so be warned.
* __Keyboards__: At home I use the amazing Keychron C3 Pro wired keyboard. This is the best mechanical keyboard I could find at this price range and it punches way above its weight. Anywhere else, I use the Logitech K380 Bluetooth keyboard. It is OK and mostly on this list because of its size.
* __Stand__: I use the Roost laptop stand when I am not at home. It isn't cheap, but it is light and well made and worth the price.
