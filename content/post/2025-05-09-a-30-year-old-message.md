I mentioned earlier this week that growing up, I was [lucky to have access](https://sanfranciscan.org/2025/05/04/before-our-attention-was-a-commodity/) to the Internet before the web. This meant I was able to take full advantage when I figured out how to use my dad's dial-up account at Vanderbilt University during Christmas break in early January 1995.

Being a kid, one of my first instincts was to find a game to play online. With web search engines still rudimentary back then, I turned to Usenet, which I had been using for a few years. I posted a message to `comp.sys.mac.games` to help me find a game I could play over TCP/IP. For the sake of posterity, I posted [the full message here](https://sanfranciscan.org/1995/01/04/any-tcp-game/). A less detailed version is also available on the [Usenet Archives](https://www.usenetarchives.com/view.php?id=comp.sys.mac.games&mid=PEhFUk5BTkoxLTA0MDE5NTE1NTk1NkBkaWFsMDAyLnZhbmRlcmJpbHQuZWR1Pg).

The sole reply to my message was polite and pointed me toward [Bolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolo_(1987_video_game)), a game I've played now for more than 30 years, from classic MacOS all the way to Linux and Windows 10. So the message clearly worked.

Two small notes on continuity:

* I first archived this message 15 years ago, on Friday, June 11, 2010, at 21:45:54, when I was living in Lausanne, Switzerland. As much time has passed since I archived the message as had passed between its original posting and when I archived it.
* The host machine I used to send that message three decades ago, `ctrvx1.vanderbilt.edu` (Vanderbilt's Central VAX), directly inspired my domain choice for my alternate fediverse instance: [`ctrvx.net`](https://sanfranciscan.org/2024/05/12/a-central-virtual-extension-into-the-network/).

Even on the Internet, time passes quickly!
