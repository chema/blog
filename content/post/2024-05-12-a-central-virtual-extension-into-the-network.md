After much procrastination, I finally deployed a [snac](https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2) fediverse instance today. Snac (an acronym for *social networks are crap*) is a lightweight fediverse server written in C, the only programming language I still use. It is fast, has few dependencies, was simple to install and works well with some solid clients like Tusky and the [Phanpy](https://github.com/cheeaun/phanpy) web client.<!--more-->

I decided to use a new domain name for this instance, settling on [`ctrvx.net`](https://ctrvx.net/). It's a throwback to my very first email address (`username@ctrvx...edu`) from 30 years ago, back when I was a freshman in high school and was lucky enough to have internet access through my local university's central [VAX mainframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX) thanks to my dad.

So taking inspiration from the original VAX acronym (**Virtual Address eXtension**), `ctrvx.net` now becomes a backronym for a **CenTRal Virtual eXtension into the NETwork**, an apt description of the instance. I am quite proud of having a domain name with such a long personal history!

For the time being, `ctrvx.net` will be an alternate instance to [my primary instance](https://social.sanfranciscan.org/chema), but I intend to eventually migrate what I can from my main account to `ctrvx.net` so I can wind down social.sanfranciscan.org.

`ctrvx.net` runs on my home server, along with this blog, so as long as I pay the domain names and my internet connection, this extension into the network is golden. One thing I am doing differently with my `ctrvx.net` account is that posts will disappear after about 40 days. This will (hopefully) encourage me to turn some of my longer, more in-depth threads into actual blog posts, where they can live with a bit more permanence, instead of just floating in the Ã¦ther.

Another example of why I am both amused and frustrated by the "people" (mostly billionaire speculators and their acolytes) who keep talking about "*building decentralized social media*" when the fediverse is already a very real and very active decentralized social media. The challenge is that it cannot be monetized to their advantage and its structure is inherently anti-authoritarian, which doesn't center their own, very personal vision of what decentralized means. So they will criticize it and sideline it, but it isn't going anywhere.
