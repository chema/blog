After much procrastination, I finally deployed a [snac](https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2) fediverse instance today. For the time being, it will be an alternate to [my principal instance](https://social.sanfranciscan.org/chema). I decided to use a new domain name, settling on [ctrvx.net](https://ctrvx.net/). It's a throwback to my very first email address from 30 years ago, back when I was a freshman in high school and was lucky enough to have internet access through my local university's central [VAX mainframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX).<!--more-->

Taking inspiration from the original VAX acronym, the domain name is a play on words, signifying a *c*en*tr*al *v*irtual e*x*tension into the *net*work, which is an apt description of the instance. I am rather proud of this little accomplishment.

I intend to eventually migrate what I can from my main account to ctrvx.net so I can wind down social.sanfranciscan.org. I chose snac because it is written in C (which is the only programming language I still use), so it is fast and has few dependencies. It was simple to install and works well with some solid clients like Tusky.

Ctrvx.net runs on my home server, along with this blog, so as long as I pay the domain names and my internet connection, this extension into the network is golden. One thing I am doing differently with my ctrvx.net account is that posts will disappear after about 40 days. This will (hopefully) encourage me to turn some of my longer, more in-depth threads into actual blog posts, where they can live with a bit more permanence, instead of just floating in the Ã¦ther.

Another example of why I am both amused and frustrated by the "people" (mostly billionaire speculators and their acolytes) who keep talking about "*building decentralized social media*" when the fediverse is already a very real and very active decentralized social media. The challenge is that it cannot be monetized to their advantage and its structure is inherently anti-authoritarian, which doesn't center their own, very personal vision of what decentralized means. So they will criticize it and sideline it, but it isn't going anywhere.
