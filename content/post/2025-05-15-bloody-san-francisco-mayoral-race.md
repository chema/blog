## The Story
SF Chronicle editor-in-chief accuses the racist labor mayoral candidate of adultery and his dad of *sundry immoralities*. Candidate fires back, "His mom ran a whorehouse." Enraged editor shoots the candidate in the street, once in the chest, once as he ran away. Wounded candidate gets elected Mayor of SF. A few months later, the mayorâ€™s son assassinates the editor in the Chronicle building.

All of this [really happened](

The characters in this real-life soap opera were our 18th mayor, [Isaac Smith Kalloch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Smith_Kalloch); his son, Isaac; and [SF Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/) Editor-in-Chief [Charles de Young](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Young) (brother of Harry de Young, namesake of the [de Young Museum](https://www.famsf.org/visit/de-young)).

## Bullets Versus Field Game

True-crime-meets-politics stories like this make me grateful to do political work in today's San Francisco. Our politics are thorny enough as it is. I'd hate to think I needed to pack heat just to do my job. Or worse, get strung up or end up floating in the Bay. Uppity Mexicans didn't fare too well back then.

I'll take a laptop and some door hangers over bullets any day.
